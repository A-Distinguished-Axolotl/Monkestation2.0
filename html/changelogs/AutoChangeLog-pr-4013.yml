changes:
  - rscadd: "Added the pride pin quirk"
  - image: "adds special sprites for lungs when you use the smoker quirk"
  - rscadd: "Added the ability to adjust neck clothing items to reveal accessories"
  - rscadd: "New funny internals for the clowns to spawn with. They come with O2 and a secondary gas between 3 options: BZ, Helium and N2O. Talk with a \"different tone\" with Helium, giggle and laugh \"uncontrollably\" while under the minor effects of N2O or have \"fun\" hallucinations while under the minor effects of BZ."
  - balance: "To not cut on how long the clown's O2 internals last due to the mixed gases, the funny internals have 50% more gas volume, same as engineers' internals."
  - rscadd: "You can now choose the prosthetic you want with the Prosthetic Limb quirk."
  - refactor: "split the three tg quirk files into separate files for each quirk"
