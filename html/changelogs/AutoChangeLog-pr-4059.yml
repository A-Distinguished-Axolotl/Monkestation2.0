  - rscadd: "GPSes now show the general direction of \"calibrated\" Z-levels, altho there's currently no way of manually calibrating them."
  - rscadd: "GPSes will always be pre-calibrated to be capable of pointing back to whichever z-level they were created on."
  - rscadd: "Added the advanced GPS, behind the Miniaturized Bluespace Research node, which does not require calibration at all."
  - rscadd: "The \"First Man on the Moon\" curator kit now comes with an advanced GPS - it's no longer an objectively worse version of the carp hunter kit!"
