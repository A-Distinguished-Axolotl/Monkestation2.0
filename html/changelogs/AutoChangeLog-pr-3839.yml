changes:
  - bugfix: "Changeling's \"Adrenaline Sacs\" ability no longer keeps you borderline stamcrit."
  - balance: "Changeling adrenaline is much better at combatting stuns and it's cost is now 20 chemicals. (down from 30)"
  - refactor: "Changeling adrenaline is now a status effect, changeling haste still exists (and works) because it was used somewhere."
  - balance: "Strained muscles now costs 10 chemicals to activate and the downside works properly now."
  - balance: "Strained muscles accumulates via delta time now, so lag won't save you from it."
  - refactor: "Strained muscles is now a status effect."
  - balance: "Biodegrade now costs 20 chemicals down from 30."
  - balance: "Lesser form now costs 15 chemicals down from 20."
  - bugfix: "Lesser form (and other species changes) carry over limb damage."
  - balance: "Changeling Sting (the drink) is viable to use for chemicals now."
  - balance: "Anatomic panacea is more consistent now via becoming a status effect as well."
  - rscadd: "Adds a new changeling ability, \"Darkness Adaptation\". Making you more translucent, especially in darkness and allowing you to see slightly better in the dark. (Ghommie)"
  - balance: "The changeling power \"Chameleon Skin\" has been buffed, Reduces the cost to 1 and sped up the time it takes to turn invisible. (Ghommie)"
  - bugfix: "Unlike upstream, \"Chameleon Skin\" and \"Darkness Adaptation\", while still overriding each other, don't break if you turn off chameleon skin while in darkness adaptation. (i.e. it'll turn you translucent again)"
  - bugfix: "Paralysis, stun, etc. diminishment no longer applies to decreasing their duration."
  - spellcheck: "A lot of changeling ability descriptions are better now. I didn't go through all of them, but some of the durations are directly mentioned rather than just \"short\" or \"long\" with no reference point as to what that means."
