changes:
  - spellcheck: "The flavor text for the bloodsucker Venture clan now properly says to use a persuasion rack instead of a candelabrum to level their favorite vassal up."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed bloodsucker-related moodlets having blank lines after them."
  - bugfix: "Clicking on the persuasion rack while a vassal is buckled after a revenge or favorite vassal has been selected won't automatically make the buckled vassal into the other without prompting."
  - bugfix: "Fixed being able to vassalize antags/mindshielded people regardless of whether they accepted the prompt or not."
